Feature: Model which acts as token authenticatable requires authentication
  As a developer
  In order to protect some models with token authentication
  I want any model which acts as token authenticatable to require authentication

  @rspec
  Scenario: Before calling `acts_as_token_authenticatable` no authentication is required
    Given I have a dummy app

    And I run `rails generate scaffold post title:string body:text --test-framework rspec --fixture-replacement factory_girl`
    And I run `rails generate scaffold private_post title:string body:text --test-framework rspec --fixture-replacement factory_girl`
    And I prepare the test database

    And I overwrite "app/controllers/application_controller.rb" with:
      """
      class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
        # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
        # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
        protect_from_forgery with: :exception

        # While `acts_as_token_authentication_handler` was not called,
        # neither should be `authenticate_user!`.
        # See https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication/issues/8

        # Yet once `acts_as_token_authentication_handler` was called, `authenticate_user!`
        # should also be called. Run `rspec` to ensure that's being true.
        # If called, the `authenticate_user!` method will raise an exception, that
        # allows both cases to be covered by their own spec example.
