Feature: Smoke test
  As a developer
  In order to make sure Rails Engine Decorators is correctly configured
  I want to run a smoke test

  Scenario: Decorating a controller from the application (without Rails Engine Decorators)
    Given I have a dummy app with a Devise-enabled User
    And a scaffolded PrivatePost
    And I prepare the test database
    And the `authenticate_user!` and `sign_in` methods always raise an exception
    And User `acts_as_token_authenticatable`
    And PrivatePostsController `acts_as_token_authentication_handler_for` User
    And I append to "app/controllers/private_posts_controller.rb" with:
